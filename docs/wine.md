## Wine-TKG ‚îÄ Windows compatibility layer

---

**Builds a custom Wine or Wine-Staging version from the Frogging-Family, tailored for gaming and general application use.**

---

### Key Information:

- **Dependencies:** Requires numerous build dependencies for compiling Wine (e.g., 32-bit libraries).
- **Process:** The installer clones the `wine-tkg-git` repository, navigates to the `wine-tkg-git` subdirectory, and runs the build script.
- **Build Time:** Compiling Wine is a resource-intensive process and can take a significant amount of time.
- **Customization:** Use the `wine-tkg.cfg` file to choose between staging and stable, apply patches, and configure the build.
- **Post-Install:** The custom Wine build will be installed on your system, ready to be used by launchers like Lutris or the command line.

---

### Quick Commands

- **Install:**  
  `tkginstaller wine` or `tkginstaller w`
- **Edit Config:**  
  `tkginstaller wine config` or `tkginstaller w c`  
  `tkginstaller config wine` or `tkginstaller c w`

---

### Configuration

- **Config Location:**  
  Default: `~/.config/frogminer/wine-tkg.cfg`
- **Missing Config:**  
  If the config file is missing, TKG-Installer will prompt you to download the latest version from Frogging-Family.
- **Manual Updates:**  
  Wine configuration options may change. Update your config regularly for new features and fixes.
- **Backup:**  
  Always back up your config before making changes.

---

### Troubleshooting

- **Invalid or incomplete arguments:**  
  If you provide an invalid or incomplete command, TKG-Installer will show usage instructions and examples.
- **Permissions:**  
  Do not run TKG-Installer as root. Use a regular user account for security.
- **Build Errors:**  
  Check that all dependencies are installed and your config is valid.

### Tips

- Ensure you have enough free disk space and RAM for the compilation.
