### üß† Linux-TKG ‚îÄ Custom Linux kernels

---

**Installs a custom-patched Linux kernel from the Frogging-Family, optimized for performance and gaming.**

---

### Key Information:

- **Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary build dependencies for compiling a kernel on your distribution (e.g., `base-devel` on Arch).
- **Process:** The installer clones the repository, builds the kernel using your external configuration, and installs it.
- **Build Time:** Compiling a kernel can take a significant amount of time, depending on your hardware.
- **Customization:** Allows for deep customization via the `linux-tkg.cfg` file. Use the configuration editor to tweak build options.
- **Post-Install:** After a successful installation, you must **reboot** your system to use the new kernel.

### Quick Commands:

- **Install:** `tkginstaller linux` or `tkginstaller l`
- **Edit Config:** `tkginstaller linux config` or `tkginstaller l c`

### Tips:

- Ensure you have enough free disk space, as kernel sources are large.
- Join the Frogging-Family community for support and updates.
