## üéÆ Proton-TKG ‚îÄ Windows compatibility layer for Steam / Gaming

---

**Builds a custom Proton-TKG version from the Frogging-Family, allowing for fine-tuned performance and compatibility for Windows games on Linux via Steam.**

---

### Key Information:

- **Dependencies:** Requires a working Steam installation and numerous build dependencies for compiling Wine and other components.
- **Process:** The installer clones the `wine-tkg-git` repository, navigates to the `proton-tkg` directory, and executes the build script.
- **Build Time:** Compiling a full Proton environment is a lengthy process and can take a significant amount of time.
- **Customization:** Use the `proton-tkg.cfg` file to apply specific patches, change component versions, and tweak build options.
- **Post-Install:** The resulting Proton build will be placed in your Steam compatibility tools directory (`~/.steam/root/compatibilitytools.d/`). You must restart Steam to select and use it.
